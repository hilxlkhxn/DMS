            <h2>About the Department</h2>
            <p>Aligarh Muslim Univrsity has been at the forefront of Management education in India. In 1965 a one-year Diploma in Business Administration started under the aegis of the Department of Commerce. In 1969, it was replaced by a three-year part-time Diploma Program in Business Management (DBM). It was converted into a part-time, three-year program leading to the Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1972. In the same year, a separate Department of Business Administration was created. The three year part-time MBA program was further upgraded to a two year full-time MBA in 1976. Regular PhD programme in Business Administration was also introduced along with the creation of the Department.
                <br><br>
                Since then, the Department has strived towards excellence, introducing several PG diploma courses in 1984, a two-year Masterâ€™s programme in International Business in 1993, and a one-year PG Diploma in Islamic Banking & Finance in 2010. Given the changing needs, the Department has upgraded and refined its offerings and, in 2019, has launched two MBA programmes in niche areas of Islamic Banking & Finance and Hospital Administration.
                <br><br>
                The Department of Business Administration, working under the umbrella of the Faculty of Management Studies and Research (FMSR), currently offers Master in Business Administration (MBA), MBA (International Business), MBA (Islamic Banking & Finance) and MBA (Hospital Administration). Apart from these MBA and regular PhD programmes, the Department also offers an Executive Doctoral Programme, in collaboration with All India Management Association (AIMA) for executives, managers, management educators, central & state government and military personnel etc. This program has received an overwhelming response and has helped the Department carve a niche in management research.</p>
